    <h3>Question 1: Difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
        sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is
        loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>

    <h3>Question 2: Difference between local scope and block scope?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
        sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is
        loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: How javascript event loop works?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
        empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
        effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
